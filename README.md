Buying drinks has never been simpler.

Just put a json file named items.json in Documents/kiosk/items.json

```
[
  {
    "name": "Spezi",
    "price": 1.6,
    "image": "<base64image>"
  },
  {
    "name": "Spezi",
    "price": 1.6,
    "image": "<base64image>"
  },
  ...
]

```

And a json file named user.json in Documents/kiosk/user.json

```
